# Hi, I’m Kade 

I spent over 10 years running my own construction business, but I’ve always been drawn to tech and building things digitally.  
Now I’m diving deep into web development, working on projects that let me turn ideas into working apps.  

I enjoy experimenting, trying out new stacks, and building tools that could actually help people — from renovation ROI calculators to simple scoring apps.

## Interests
Outside of coding, I’m into aviation and paragliding, and I like getting outdoors with trail running and multisport.  
I also tinker with UAVs, UGVs, robotics, and electronics — anything hands-on where I can build and test ideas.  
On the business side, I’m into property investment and looking for ways to combine my tech skills with real-world projects.
